# Info-Ninja: AI-Powered Competitive Intelligence Platform

## Inspiration

In today's fast-paced business environment, companies spend weeks manually gathering competitive intelligence - scraping websites, analyzing reports, and synthesizing insights. We were inspired to create **Info-Ninja** after witnessing how businesses struggle with:

- **Time-consuming research**: Manual competitive analysis taking 2-4 weeks
- **Scattered information**: Data spread across multiple sources and formats
- **Lack of focus**: Generic analysis that doesn't address specific business needs
- **Poor visualization**: Text-heavy reports that executives can't quickly digest

We envisioned an AI system that could deliver executive-ready competitive intelligence in minutes, not weeks.

- **Graceful Degradation**: System works seamlessly even when Redis is unavailable

### **Key Technical Innovations**

```python
# Redis niche-aware cache keys with TTL management
cache_key = generate_cache_key("analysis", {
    "competitor": company_name,
    "website": company_website,
    "niche": analysis_focus  # IT, Sales, Marketing, etc.
})
redis_client.setex(cache_key, ttl=86400, value=analysis_data)

# Bright Data integration with diverse source targeting
configured_bright_data = get_configured_bright_data()
search_queries = generate_niche_queries(competitor, niche)
# Searches: company sites, job boards, review platforms, social media

# LlamaIndex document processing pipeline
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, Document
documents = [Document(text=scraped_content) for scraped_content in bright_data_results]
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
```

## Challenges we ran into

### **1. Multi-Source Data Integration**

- **Problem**: Bright Data initially returning similar information from different queries, limiting intelligence depth
